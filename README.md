CanaryAndroidApp (BattleHack 2014)
================

Simple Android application with a "login" and a main page. The main page uses an Adafruit BLUE
library that allows from communication using BLE to UART. The library is located at
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Android_BLE_UART. It then currently connects to Parse and
pushes the data to a Parse database. Bluetooth disconnects sometimes, but works as programmed
most of the time. 


NOTE: ASB.iml should be Canary.iml, as ASB was a previous version, also please check out the
Adafruit README located directly in the folder. 

Thank you to Adafruit for such an easy library/example to incorporate and to the Canary team for a great
hackathon experience/time.
